\begin{abstract}
A new high resolution neutron detector concept which time of flight measurements is proposed. Energy resolutions from time of flight measurements are determined by the uncertainty in timing and position. A single NEXT module will be composed of thin segments of neutron-discriminating plastic scintillator, each optically separated, coupled to a position sensitive detector for the readout. The goal of NEXT is to maintain neutron detection efficiency and reduce uncertainties in time of flight energy calculations.

\section{Introduction}
New generation radioactive ion beam facilities enable access to very neutron rich nuclei, approaching, and even reaching the neutron drip-line in certain
cases \cite{FRIB}.
Far from stability, neutron separation energies decrease as beta-decay endpoint energies become large, increasing the likelihood of beta-delayed neutron emission. Neutron spectroscopy becomes essential to obtain important information about the nuclear structure for these very neutron-rich nuclei. 
Neutron dEtector with (X) Tracking (NEXT) has been devoloped to improve neutron spectroscopy energy resolution while still being viable to observe low production rate beta-delayed neutron emitters close to the neutron drip line. 
This high-precision neutron detector will also be applicable to single proton transfer reactions used to probe single-particle proton states of exotic nuclei. NEXT has also been designed around neutron-gamma discriminating scintillator in order to improve background rejection. Prevelant gamma-ray background common in decay and reaction experimental setups can be removed from neutron spectra, further improving neutron energy measurements.

\section{ Detector Design}

When the neutron kinetic  energies are measured via time-of-flight, the energy resolution is given by the following expression \cite{KORNILOV2009226}:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta E}{E}=\sqrt{\left(\frac{2\Delta t}{t}\right )^2+\left(\frac{2\Delta L}{L}\right )^2},
\label{eq:resolution}
\end{equation}

in which $t$  is the time-of-flight of the particle ($\Delta$ t is uncertainty in time-of-flight) and $L$ is the corresponding flight path-length ($\Delta$ L is the uncertainty in neutron path-length). Therefore, the energy resolution is directly related with the time resolution of the detection system, and the precision in the measurement of the path-length. The latter is mainly due the the uncertainty in the determination of the interaction point within the detector. One of the factors which limits this precision is the required thickness facing the trajectory, because the interaction can occur anywhere within the detector. Thick detectors are needed to maintain neutron detection efficiency, but at the expense of a good position resolution. Typical thicknesses for plastic-scintillator-based neutron detectors are about 3~cm, which is a good trade-off between position resolution and efficiency \cite{PETERS2016122,BUTA2000412}.

Standard plastic scintillator exhibits the same response from gamma-ray scattering as neutron scattering, making the two events indiscernible. In order to correct this behavior, many types of neutron-gamma discriminating scintillators have been developed to improve gamma-ray background rejection in neutron time of flight distributions. By utilizing the slower neutron response as compared to gamma-ray scintillation, background can be rejected using varying pulse shape discrimination methods [MAYBE ADD MORE AND CLEAN UP].

\subsubsection{Detector Requirements}
The NEXT detector has to be able to accurately measure neutron energies below 10~MeV. This is the region of interest for beta-delayed neutron emission and single nucleon transfer reactions, in which the neutrons emitted at forward angles in the center of mass frame have low energies.  

Figure \ref{fig:resolution} shows how the energy resolution is  affected by the thickness of the detector and the time resolution for a 1~m flight distance using Eq. \eqref{eq:resolution}. We observe that the 3~cm uncertainty in the distance of the existing VANDLE \cite{PETERS2016122} array is the main limitation in the energy resolution of this detector, especially at neutron energies above 2~MeV. Lower detector thicknesses, (3-6~mm) will have lower uncertainty in the determination of the position and  the contribution due to the time resolution becomes more important.

NEXT will also have to discriminate between neutrons and gamma-rays, not only directly from decays and reactions, but also the consistent experimental background. Prompt gamma-rays tend to impact high neutron energy measurements where gamma-rays can scatter within the experimental halls and are incorrectly measured with a large solid-angle detector.

There are few options available for pulse shape discriminating plastic scintillator, the most prevelant being EJ-299 (Eljen Technologies). Previously, EJ-299 was a softer plastic scintillator, incapable of being machined into desired detector geometries. With the advent of EJ-276, a derivative of EJ-299 with crosslinking to increase rigidity, a machinable n-gamma discriminating plastic scintillator is economically available to construct large scale detector arrays.

\label{fig:NEXT_modules}
\end{figure}


The NEXT concept is based on modules of 8 multi-layered plastic scintillator detectors. Each  module consists of 8 6-mm-thick layers of plastic scintillator, therefore the total effective thickness is 4.8~cm. Both ends of the scintillator are coupled to position sensitive photosensors for reading out the light produced from scattered particles in the plastic. These photon sensors considered  are either an array of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) or flat panel multi anode photomultiplier tubes (MAPMTs). Position sensitivity together with multiple thin layers will makes it possible to determine  accurately the interaction point of the neutrons inside the detector, reducing the uncertainty in the determination of the flight path-length, which together with the sub-nanosecond timing resolution of SiPMs and MAPMTs will improve the energy resolution significantly.

\section{Conclusions}
After extensive development guided by simulations and single segment tests, a NEXT prototype has been built with 4x8 segmentation. The SensL\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} J-Series SiPMs successfully measured neutron time of flight with less than 600 ps timing resolution, validating SiPMs as potential detectors for future development.
