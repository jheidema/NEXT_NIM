\section{Detector Prototyping}
The development phase of the NEXT project investigated single segment scintillator prototypes of various geometries and different photosensors. The key point of these tests was to explore whether the scintillation produced in the interaction of neutrons in the plastic would be sufficient enough to retain the timing and neutron-gamma discrimination capabilities under particular detector geometry requirements.

\subsection{Detector and Data Acquisition}
To investigate the timing performance of varying detector setups, coincidence time distributions and time of flight distributions between photosensors attached to opposite ends of plastic scintillators were measured. Two main types of detector setups were tested, the first being small scintillators attached to SiPMs to determine SiPM timing capabilities, and the second was bars of EJ276 coupled to small fast timing PMTs in order to determine the feasability of incorporating n-$\gamma$  discriminating plastic. For both setups, the same data acquisition (DAQ) was used to record signals from the detector setup. The system utilized 16-bit, 250 MHz Pixie-16 digitizers developed by XIA LLC \cite{XIA} to digitize and store traces for later high resolution timing analysis. A detailed description of a similar DAQ setup can be found in \cite{PAULAUSKAS201422}.

\subsection{High Resolution Timing} \label{sec:HRT}

\label{fig:SiPMtiming}
\end{figure}
Time-of-flight as well as position of the scintillation interaction between two photo-detectors can be determined using the time differences between the signals from each end of a length of scintillator. The internal timestamping of the XIA Pixie-16 digitizers is only in 8~ns intervals so a method to determine a more precise timing was implemented.
The high resolution time of each digitized pulse was determined by means of a Polynomial Constant Fraction Discrimination  algorithm (PolyCFD) \cite{PhDCory}. The algorithm calculates the maximum from a polynomial fit around the peak of the digitized pulse and it calculates the CFD threshold as a fraction of the difference between the maximum and the baseline. The high resolution timestamp is found from a linear interpolation between the points surrounding the CFD threshold in the leading edge. The optimum threshold fraction values were obtained for a factor range between $F=40-45\%$. A graphical representation of the PolyCFD method can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:PolyCFD}.

A $^{90}$Sr source was employed to measure left-right position resolution because of the effective collimation due to the short range of the beta particles within the scintillator material. The $^{90}$Sr source also provided a wide range of energy depositions from tens of keV up to $\sim$2~MeV. This helped establish the timing performance of different detector setups as a function of energy deposition in the scintillator. To determine time-of-flight capabalities of varying detector setups, neutrons from a readily available $^{252}$Cf fission source were observed and their respective flight times were measured between START and STOP detectors. The $^{252}$Cf neutron emission is very well characterized and is provides a good test of a time-of-flight detector's capabilities. 

\section{Timing with SiPMs} \label{sec:timingWithSiPMs}

Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) offer a small form factor solution to detector design and quantum efficiency uniformity for multi-detector arrays. SiPM position and time-of-flight resolution was measured to test their applicability to a small scale array. Two different readout circuits were designed for the SiPM timing measurements to measure the effects of the onboard filtering/amplification. The first one consisted of a simple low-pass active filter based on the Texas Instruments\textsuperscript{\textregistered} OPA656 operational amplifier recommended by the SiPM manufacturer \cite{JseriesUM}. The feedback resistor value was chosen to be $25\Omega$ to maintain the fast rise-time of the SiPM signal while filtering high-frequency noise. The second circuit tested does not have any on-board amplification. Pairs of the same SiPM signal readout boards were tested with a teflon-wrapped $50\times6\times6$~mm$^3$ piece of EJ-200 plastic scintillator between them. For each pair, the signals were amplified and gain matched using an ORTEC\textsuperscript{\textregistered} 535 fast amplifier module.

\subsection{SiPM Position Resolution}
Figure \ref{fig:SiPMtiming} shows the results of the timing measurements using the teflon-wrapped piece of EJ-200 with the two circuits mentioned previously. The left panels correspond to the circuit with active onboard amplification and right ones the the circuit with no onboard amplification. The top panels show 2D-histograms of the left-right time difference and the deposited energy in the plastic scintillator with on-board SiPM amplification (left) and without amplification (right). The maximum of the energy distribution in the case of the SiPM circuit with amplification is lower than the one without it. This is due to the fact that signals with amplitudes larger than 1~V saturate the ADCs and were not included in the histogram. The gain of the amplifier included in the SiPM circuit boards produces the saturation at smaller energy deposition. It is also worth mentioning that the the distribution corresponding to the non amplified circuit shows a significant walk effect at high energy deposition compared to the amplified board.

  \caption{Two-dimensional histogram of $^{252}$Cf time of flight measurements plotted against deposited energy in the EJ-200 stop detector. The inset show a logarithm projection onto the time of flight axis. The timing resolution was determined to be 544~ps from a gaussian fit to the gamma peak.}
  \label{fig:ToF_SiPM}
\end{figure}

Lower panels of Figure \ref{fig:SiPMtiming}, show projections on the time axis of the histograms shown in the upper panel. The time resolution is obtained from  gaussian fits of the time distributions. The resolutions obtained for the amplified circuit and the non-amplified one are $\Delta t=469$~ps (FWHM), and $\Delta t=548$~ps (FWHM) respectively.

\subsection{Time of Flight with SiPMs}

As a proof of principle, a small scale ToF setup (30~cm flight path) was implemented to measure neutron flight times from a $^{252}$Cf source. The setup consisted of a $20\times6\times6$~mm$^3$  piece of EJ-200 plastic scintillator attached to $6\times6$~mm$^2$ SensL\textsuperscript{\textregistered} SiPMs used as a START detector and a  $100\times6\times6$~mm$^3$ scintillator bar attached to another pair of SensL\textsuperscript{\textregistered} SiPMs used as the STOP detector. Both detectors were placed 30~cm apart and the same DAQ was used from the position resolution tests. A ToF vs. deposited energy distribution can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:ToF_SiPM}, along with a 1-D projection showing the gaussian fit to the gamma-ray peak. Using the PolyCFD method, the time of flight resolution for the SiPM setup was determined to be $\Delta t=544$~ps (FWHM).

The small scale SiPM timing tests establish SiPMs as viable detectors for small scale arrays. Testing will continue to determine scalability of SiPMs to a large, multi-detector resistive readout system.

\section{Eljen 276 Detector Tests}

 \label{fig:TOFEJ276}
\end{figure}
 
Timing performance of $127\times12.7\times6$ mm\textsuperscript{3} EJ-276 bars was tested using fast, compact Hamamatsu R11265U photomultipliers. The bars of EJ-276 were machined from 12.7~mm thick sheets by Agile Technologies, Inc. and were wrapped with either 3M\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} ESR (Enhanced Specular Reflector) or Lumirror\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} (produced by Toray). Some bars were also provided with no wrapping to determine the effect of the reflective layers.

  \caption{Two dimensional histograms of the CCM PSD for three different types of wrapping.}
  \label{fig:PSDEJ276}
\end{figure*}
ESR is a specular reflector with 98\% reflectivity in the visible spectrum and Lumirror\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} is a diffuse reflector similar to teflon. Both wrappings were applied to the EJ-276 bars using an UV-cured optical adhesive. Figure \ref{fig:MylarTiming} shows the 2D-histogram of left-right time difference plotted against the deposited energy in the ESR-wrapped EJ-276 scintillator. The inset in Figure \ref{fig:MylarTiming} shows the y-axis projection of the timing resolution as a gaussian distribution. From a fit to the time difference projection, the left-right timing resolution is $\Delta t=543$~ps (FWHM). A thick mylar film on the $^{90}$Sr source caused the energy spectrum to be compressed by approximately 500~keV, as seen in the endpoint energy rougly around 1700~keV in Fig. \ref{fig:MylarTiming}.  The Lumirror\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} wrapped detector was not tested for timing due to the poor neutron-gamma discrimination that will explained in Section \ref{sec:PSD}.
A ToF setup similar to the SiPM test was made to measure the time of flight resolution for a single 127~mm long bar of EJ-276 plastic scintillator wrapped with ESR. Utilizing the same start detctor from the SiPM time of flight setup and the EJ-276 bar coupled to PMTS as the stop detector, the $^{252}$Cf ToF spectrum was measured. From a fit to the gamma-ray peak in the the time of flight spectrum, the time resolution was determined to be $\Delta t=538$~ps [50keVee threshold applied].

\subsection{neutron-${\mathit \gamma}$ discrimination} \label{sec:PSD}
EJ-276 evolved from first-generation neutron-gamma discriminating plastic scintillator, EJ-299. Typical solid-state scintillators are cast or grown in specific molds, limiting detector designs. EJ-276 is capable of being cut and polished in desired geometries to optimize detector light collection. The pulse shape discrimination (PSD) response of EJ-276 is the same as EJ-299 with a slower neutron decay component than the gamma-ray response. The PSD response mechanism for EJ-299 can be found accurately described in \cite{Zaitseva2012}. The materials response to neutron and gamma-ray scattering was tested for the long narrow segments with different wrappings.

The higher segmentation is along the flight path for the best position and timing resolution.}

\end{figure}
%\subsubsection{Wrapping Tests}
 Two wrapped bars from Agile Technologies, Inc. (3M\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} ESR and Lumirror\textsuperscript{\texttrademark}) and a third bare bar wrapped with teflon were tested to measure the effect of the outer reflective layer on the pulse shape discrimination. The neutron and gamma-ray responses from EJ-276 were recorded with the same 16 bit 250 MHz digitizer used for earlier setups, and the pulse shape discrimination was tested using the Charge Comparison Method \cite{CCMPSD}. By measuring the total and partial (tail) integral of each signal and calculating the ratio between the two integrals, neutrons scattering events can be separated from gamma-ray scatters. This approach is further improved by utilizing both ratios from detectors on either end of a scintillator bar and calculating the geometric mean. This method has previously been determined to be optimal when using a high bit-resolution digitizer \cite{HighResPSD}.
Using the $^{252}$Cf source and a 2 inch block of lead to attenuate the large gamma-ray flux, the waveforms from each bar were digitized and tail to total integral ratios were calculated. Figure \ref{fig:PSDEJ276} shows the PSD plots for bars wrapped with Lumirror\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} (a), teflon (b), and ESR (c) with figure of merits being calculated between 400 and 500~keVee. The figure of merits for the Lumirror\textsuperscript{\texttrademark}, teflon, and ESR bars were 0.820$\pm$0.012, 1.042$\pm$0.016, and 0.977$\pm$0.015 respectively. Further tests of the bar were only done with 3M\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} ESR wrapping to maintain the best neutron-gamma discrimination.

\section{NEXT Prototype} \label{Prototype}

ESR wrapped individual EJ-276 bars were shown to meet NEXT design goals, leading to the assembly of 2x2 in$^{2}$ segmented detectors. The prototype has 4x8 scintillator cells, the higher segmentation being along the particle flight path (see Figure \ref{fig:PSPMTImage}). A full NEXT prototype is made up of one segmented array coupled to Hamamatsu H12700A position sensitive PMTs (PSPMTs) on each end of the segmented scintillator. The H12700A PSPMTs have an 8x8 segmentation (64 6x6 mm$^{2}$ anodes), each anode having an individual readout. A Vertilon PSPMT Anger Logic interface board (Model SIB064B-1018) was used to reduce the position sensitive readout from 64 individual position signals to 4 position signals, one at each corner of the SIB064B-1018 resistive network. The scintillation position is reconstructed using the weighted average of the 4 corner resistive network signals based on their respective signal integrals \cite{ANGER}. Figure \ref{fig:PSPMTImage} shows the reconstructed array segmentations from the Anger Logic position measurement of the PSPMTs using scintillation data from a $^{60}$Co source. The PSPMT common dynode signal used for timing is connected directly to the acquistion. The scintillator cell dependent analysis calculates neutron energies on a segment by segment basis (using reconstructed positions).

 \label{fig:PSPMTPSD}
\end{figure}

To measure the prototype time of flight resolution, a collimated $^{60}$Co source was used. Figure \ref{fig:CollimatedCoToF} shows the time of flight distribution for a single column. From a gaussian fit to the distribution, the time of flight resolution is $\Delta$t=543~ps [30 keVee threshold]. Once the prototype was established to have high resolution timing, a proof-of-principle neutron energy measurement was made using the $^{252}$Cf source. The source was placed at a distance of 439.7~mm from the front face of the prototype. The neutron yield shown in Figure \ref{fig:Cf252Spectrum} was calculated using time-of-flight information and a neutron gate has been applied using the PSD information shown in Figure \ref{fig:PSPMTPSD}. The disagreement at low neutron energy is likely due to a stringent detection threshold in simulated efficiency data which was folded with the Watt equation. The standard Mannhart parameters were fixed for the Watt equation in a fit to the spectrum, with an additional scaling parameter which was floated to match the data \cite{Mannhart}. 

\subsection{neutron-${\mathit \gamma}$ discrimination}
The PSPMT response is different then that of the fast timing PMTs used to initially test EJ-276. This response affects the overall pulse shape, potentially affecting the pulse shape discrimination capabilities. The dynode signals contain the pulse shape discrimination information. The four position signals lose neutron-gamma information after passing through the resistive network. Figure \ref{fig:PSPMTPSD} shows the neutron-gamma discrimination using the CCM. Using the same energy cuts from the wrapping tests, the FOM is 1.070$\pm$0.016. The NEXT protype does not show any noticeable effect on neutron-gamma discrimination due to segmentation or multi-anode readout.

\section{Mono-Energetic Neutron Tests}
NEXT's defining charactersitic is high precision, position dependent timing correlation. When neutrons pass through the segmented detector, there is a non-negligible amount of time a neutron takes to traverse the thickness of a single column. Neutron ToF measurements should therefore correspond to where within the detector the neutron interacted, e.g. neutrons that are determined to have interacted with a deeper column should have longer time-of-flights compared to those which interact in the front segments. For mono-energetic neutrons detected with the segmented NEXT prototype, the ToF distribution for each successive column should shift by the time it takes a neutron to traverse a single column thickness. In order to benchmark the timing-position correlation for the NEXT prototype, mono-energetic neutrons were measured at the Univesity of Kentucky Accelerator Laboratory (UKAL).

  \label{fig:ToFvsSeg}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Experimental Setup}
At UKAL, neutrons are generated in a t(p,n)$^{3}$He reaction, a d(d,n)$^{3}$He reaction, or a t(d,n)$^4$He reaction. An in-depth overview which describes the neutron production and energy selection of the UKAL can be found in \cite{HARTMAN2015137}. The t(p,n)$^{3}$He reaction was used to generate neutron energies in the 0.248 to 1.5 MeV range, but only $\sim$1~MeV neutrons will be discussed below as an example of NEXT's position dependent timing characteristics. NEXT was situated behind stacked copper, polyethylene/lead, and paraffin/lithium carbonate collimators and aligned at 55\textdegree~w.r.t. the proton beam direction, corresponding to 1013 keV neutrons. Due to the acceptance window of the detctor and collimators, observed neutron energies ranged from [??APPROX.??] 993 keV to 1035 keV.  Using the same 16 bit, 250 MHz pixie-16 based acquisition system as with previous setups, neutron time-of-flights were measured as the time difference between the proton beam pickoff signal before the tritium target and the dynode timing signals from the NEXT prototype. The specialized XIA LLC\textsuperscript{\textregistered} pixie-16 firmware allowed the acquisition to be run in triple coincidence \cite{PAULAUSKAS201422}. Although only one prototype was tested at a time, each detector requires 10 pixie channels, which can saturate the digitizer with a much lower count rate. The triple coincidence firmware has internal triggering that will only write a full event if the one start signal (proton beam pickoff) and the two stop signals (left-right dynode timing signals) both trigger within the pre-determined coincidence window. This helped lower triggering thresholds into electrical noise levels while still maintaining a stable, unsaturated count rate.

[EXPLAIN SIMULATION BEHAVIOR]
 Ideally, the shift in the mean of ToF distributions for each successive segment would be constant. A simulation replicating UKAL NEXT measurements was done to provide an estimate of the detector response to $\sim$1 MeV neutrons. 1013 keV neutrons in a pencil beam with beamspot radius 25.4~mm were simulated along a 3.1~m flight path to the front of a NEXT prototype. Only 1013~keV neutrons were simulated because the neutron energy distribution of the UKAL setup has not been fully studied. Using the full NEXT\emph{sim} simulation (GEANT4 interactions and photosensor response), neutron ToF were measured and the mean of each segments distribution was plotted against the corresponding segment number. In order to compute the optical photon center-of-mass (segment position), the weighted average is taken of the X and Y positions of each individual photon detected at the surface of the PSPMT. Each detection event is weighted using the product of the gain of the anode which was hit and the quantum efficiency of the PSPMT for a given wavelength. In doing so, a position map similar to what is shown in Figure \ref{fig:PSPMTImage} can be made using simulated data.
Figure \ref{fig:simToFvsSeg} shows the expected prototype position dependent timing behavior when detecting $\sim$1~MeV neutrons. The dashed red line is the expected fit based on 1013 keV neutron ToF calculations. The same methods used to cut on the resistive network event position in experimental data were used for position selections from optical photon center of mass calculations in the simulated data. 1013 keV neutrons traverse a single cell thickness (6.35~mm) in 0.457~ns. The first row in Table \ref{tab:Slopes} shows the shift in ToF per column ($\Delta ToF$) determined by fitting a first order polynomial to the simulated data. From the fit, $\Delta ToF$ is 0.456~ns.

To demonstrate the feasability of NEXT, a preliminary analysis was done on $\sim$1~MeV neutrons detected in three different segmented NEXT prototypes: EJ276-10 (10 inch EJ-276 4x8 array), EJ276-05 (5 inch EJ-276 4x8 srray) and EJ200-10 (10 inch EJ-200 4x8 array). For 1013 keV neutrons, the mean of the ToF distributions should shift by 0.432~ns for each successive column. The cell thickness is slightly less than used in the simulation due to manufacturing constraints, so the expected $\Delta$ is $\sim$20~ps less than was was calculated for the simulated data (0.457~ns). By making cuts for each column, the mean of each column ToF distribution was extracted using a gausian fit to 1.5$\sigma$ around the maximum. $\Delta ToF$ for each prototype was determined from a first order polynomial fit to the mean time-of-flight vs. column data shown in Figure \ref{fig:ToFvsSeg}.
\begin{comment}
  The last column in each prototype had significantly less shift than all other columns, so a fit was also performed to columns 1 to 7 as well to observe the effect of column 8 on the overall time-of-flight propagation.
\end{comment}
The $\Delta ToF$ values for the fit to each prototypes are shown in Table \ref{tab:Slopes}. Overall, each detector showed expected position dependent timing characteristics, with a clear shift in ToF measurements from column to column. The largest difference from the expected slope was observed in the EJ276-05 prototype.
Column 8 consistently had a smaller shift in ToF possibly due to improper position selection due to low statistics for this column or as a physical effect of the detector.
Continuing analysis on this data set will be performed along with other ToF data acquired for different neutron energies.
