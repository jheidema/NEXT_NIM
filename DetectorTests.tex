\section{High Resolution Timing}

To  investigate the timing performance of varying detector setups, coincidence time distributions and time of flight distributions between photosensors attached to opposite ends of plastic scintillators were measured. Two main types of detector setups were tested, the first being small scintillators attached to SiPMs to determine SiPM timing capabilities, and the second was bars of Eljen 276 coupled to small fast timing PMTs in order to determine the feasability of incorporating n-$\gamma$  discriminating plastic. For both setups, the same data acquisition (DAQ) was used to record signals from the detector setup. The system utilized 16-bit, 250 MHz Pixie-16 digitizers developed by XIA LLC \cite{XIA} to digitize and store traces for later high resolution timing analysis. [MENTION CRATE]

\subsection{Position resolution from timing}

\caption{Example of the PolyCFD algorithm on a digitized trace. Green line represents the third order polynomial fit of the maximum. Magenta line shown the linear interpolation, and the blue line the threshold level. The high resolution time is determined by the intersection between the magenta and blue lines and it is represented by the red vertical line.}
\label{fig:PolyCFD}
\end{figure}


Position of the scintillation interaction within the detector can be determined using the time difference between the signals from each detector attached to either end of the plastic scintillator. A $^{90}$Sr source was employed to measure left-right position resolution because of the effective collimation due to the short range of the beta particles within the scintillator material. The high resolution time of each digitized pulse was determined by means of a Polynomial Constant Fraction Discrimination  algorithm (PolyCFD) \cite{PhDCory}. The algorithm calculates the maximum from a polynomial fit around the peak of the digitized pulse and it calculates the CFD threshold as a fraction of the difference between the maximum and the baseline. The high resolution timestamp is found from a linear interpolation between the points surrounding the CFD threshold in the leading edge. The optimum threshold fraction values were obtained for a factor range between $F=40-45\%$. A graphical representation of the PolyCFD method can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:PolyCFD}.

\section{Timing with SiPMs} \label{sec:timingWithSiPMs}
\begin{figure}[hbt]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figures/EJ200-SiPMs.eps}
\caption{Top: Two-dimensional histogram of the left-right time difference versus the deposited energy in EJ-200 plastic scintillator from a $^{90}$Sr source, measured with on-board amplification (left) and without it (right). Bottom: Projection on the time axis of the  distributions of top panels. The red line corresponds to the gaussian fit used to determine the time resolution.}
\label{fig:SiPMtiming}
\end{figure}

Two different readout circuits were used during the SiPM measurements, one with on-board filtering and amplification and another one without them. The first one consisted of a simple low-pass active filter based on the Texas Instruments\textsuperscript{\textregistered} OPA656 operational amplifier recommended by the SiPM manufacturer. The feedback resistor value was $25\Omega$. This low resistance makes it possible to maintain the fast rise-time of the SiPM signal, while filtering high-frequency noise. The second circuit employed does not have any on-board amplification. The SiPM signals were then amplified and gain matched using an ORTEC\textsuperscript{\textregistered} 535 fast amplifier module.

Figure \ref{fig:SiPMtiming} shows the results of the timing measurements using a teflon-wrapped $50\times6\times6$~mm$^3$ piece of EJ-200 plastic scintillator with the two circuits mentioned previously. The left panels correspond to the circuit with active onboard amplification and right ones the the circuit with no onboard amplification. The top panels show 2D-histograms of the left-right time difference and the deposited energy in the plastic scintillator with on-board SiPM amplification (left) and without amplification (right). We observe that the maximum of the energy distribution in the case of the SiPM circuit with amplification is lower than the one without it. This is due to the fact that signals with amplitudes larger than 1~V saturate the ADCs and were not included in the histogram. The gain of the amplifier included in the SiPM circuit boards produces the saturation at lower values of deposited energy. It is also worth to mention that the the distribution corresponding to the non amplified circuit shows a significant walk effect at high energy deposition compared to the amplified board.

Lower panels of Fig. \ref{fig:SiPMtiming}, show projections on the time axis of the histograms shown in the upper panel. The time resolution is obtained from  gaussian fits of the time distributions. The resolutions obtained for the non-amplified circuit and the amplified one are $\Delta t=469$~ps (FWHM), and $\Delta t=548$~ps (FWHM) respectively.

\subsection{Time of Flight with SiPMs}
\begin{figure}[hbt]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/ToF_Cf252_Ej200SiPM.eps}
  \caption{Two-dimensional histogram of $^{252}$Cf time of flight measurements plotted against deposited energy in the EJ-200 stop detector. The inset show a logarithm projection onto the time of flight axis. The timing resolution was determined to be 544~ps from a gaussian fit to the gamma peak.}
  \label{fig:ToF_SiPM}
\end{figure}

As a proof of principle, a small scale time-of-flight setup (30~cm flight path) was made to measure neutron time-of-flight from a $^{252}$Cf source and determine the time-of-flight resolution. The setup consisted of a $20\times6\times6$~mm$^3$  piece of EJ-200 plastic scintillator attached to $6\times6$~mm$^2$ SensL\textsuperscript{\textregistered} SiPMs used as START detector and a  $100\times6\times6$~mm$^3$ scintillator bar attached to another pair of SensL\textsuperscript{\textregistered} SiPMs used as STOP. Both detectors were placed 30~cm apart and the same DAQ was used from the position resolution tests. The time-of-flight vs. deposited energy distribution can be seen in Figure 9, along with a 1-D projection showing the gaussian fit to the gamma-ray peak. Using the PolyCFD method, the time of flight resolution for the SiPM setup was determined to be $\Delta t=544$~ps (FWHM).

\section{Eljen 276 Detector Tests}

 \subsection{Timing Tests}

 \caption{Two-dimensional histogram of $^{252}$Cf time of flight versus deposited energy in the mylar wrapped EJ-276 stop detector. The inset is a projection of the gamma-ray peak in the time of flight spectrum and has a 524~ps FWHM.}
 \label{fig:TOFEJ276}
\end{figure}
 
Timing performance of the $127\times12.7\times6$ mm\textsuperscript{3} EJ-276 bars was tested with fast, compact Hamamatsu R11265U PMTs. The bars of EJ-276 were machined from 12.7~mm thick sheets by Agile Technologies, Inc. and wrapped with 3M\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} ESR or Lumirror\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} (produced by Toray). Some bars were also provided with no wrapping to determine the effect of the reflective layers. ESR is a specular reflector with 98\% reflectivity in the visible spectrum and Lumirror\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} is a diffuse reflector. Figure \ref{fig:MylarTiming} shows the 2D-histogram of left-right time difference against the deposited energy in the scintillator and the projection of the timing resolution results with the ESR wrapped EJ-276 bar. From a gaussian fit to the time difference projection the resolution is $\Delta t=543$~ps (FWHM). A thick mylar film on the $^{90}$Sr source caused the energy spectrum to be shifted lower by approximately 500~keV, as seen in the endpoint energy rougly around 1700~keV in Fig. \ref{fig:MylarTiming}.  The Lumirror\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} wrapped detector was not tested for timing due to the poor neutron-gamma discrimination that will be shown in Section \ref{PSDsection}.

  \caption{Two dimensional histograms of the CCM PSD of three different types of wrapping. [NON CORRECTED].}
  \label{fig:PSDEJ276}
\end{figure*}
A time-of-flight setup similar to the SiPM test was made to measure the time of flight resolution for a single 127~mm long bar of EJ-276 plastic scintillator wrapped with ESR. Utilizing the same start detctor from the SiPM time of flight setup and the EJ-276 bar coupled to PMTS as the stop detector, the $^{252}$Cf spectrum was measured again. From a fit to the gamma-ray peak in the the time of flight spectrum, the time resolution was determined to be 524~ps.

\subsection{n-${\mathit \gamma}$ discrimination} \label{PSDsection}
Eljen 276, a derivative of Eljen 299 (EJ-299), has been developed as an extremely advantageous organic plastic scintillator, not only because of it's neutron-gamma discriminating capabilities, but also due to it's machinability. Typical scintillators are cast in specific molds, limiting detector designs. EJ-276 is capable of being cut and polished in desired geometries to optimize detector light collection. The pulse shape discrimination response of EJ-276 is the same as EJ-299 with a slower neutron response decay than the gamma-ray response. The PSD response mechanism for EJ-299 can be found accurately described in \cite{Brooks1979}.
\subsubsection{Wrapping Tests}
 The neutron and gamma-ray responses from EJ-276 were recorded with the same 16 bit 250 MHz digitizer used for earlier setups, and the pulse shape discrimination was tested using the Charge Comparison Method \cite{CCMPSD}. This method was figured to be the most optimal when using a high bit-resolution digitizer \cite{HighResPSD}.
Two wrapped bars from Agile Technologies, Inc. (3M\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} ESR and Lumirror\textsuperscript{\texttrademark}) and a third bare bar wrapped with teflon were tested to measure the effect of the outer reflective layer on the pulse shape discrimination. Using the $^{252}$Cf source and a 2 inch block of lead to attenuate the large gamma-ray flux, the waveforms from each bar were digitized and tail to total integratin ratios were calculated. Figure \ref{fig:PSDEJ276} shows the PSD plots for bars wrapped with Lumirror\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} (a), teflon (b), and ESR (c) with figure of merits being calculated between 400 and 500~keVee. The figure of merits for the Lumirror\textsuperscript{\texttrademark}, teflon, and ESR bars were 0.820$\pm$0.012, 1.042$\pm$0.016, and 0.977$\pm$0.015 respectively [NON CORRECTED]. Future tests of the bar were only done with 3M\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} ESR wrapping to maintain the best neutron-gamma discrimination.

\end{figure}
SiPMs have a characteristically long decay length without any pre-amplificication. The effect of such a long decay on neutron-gamma discrimination was measured with the ESR-wrapped EJ-276 bar with a single SiPM detector on each end. The signals were digitized and analyzed with the CCM to determine the effect of light detection against detector type. Figure \ref{fig:SiPMPSD} shows the SiPM capabilities to EJ-276 neutron and gamma-ray scintillation.

\section{Prototype} \label{Prototype}

  Add picture of NEXT Prototype
\end{center}

ESR wrapped EJ-276 bars were shown to meet NEXT design goals, facilitating the assembly of a 2x2 in$^{2}$ segmented detector array. The array has 4x8 segmentation, the higher segmentation being along the particle flight path. A full NEXT module is made up of one segmented array coupled to Hamamatsu H12700A position sensitive PMTs on each end of the array. The H12700A PSPMTs have an 8x8 segmentation (64 6x6 mm$^{2}$ anodes), with each anode having an individual readout. A Vertilon PSPMT Anger Logic interface board (Model SIB064B-1018) was used to reduce the position sensitive readout to 4 position signals. Figure \ref{fig:PSPMTImage} shows the reconstructed array segmentations from the Anger Logic position measurement of the PSPMTs. The common dynode signal used for timing is passed through the interface board directly from the PSPMT. The segement dependent time-of-flight analysis calculates the neutron energies on a segment by segment basis (using the reconstructed positions).

 \caption{Neutron-gamma discrimination from the common dynode signal of the PSPMT. [CORRECTED]}
 \label{fig:PSPMTPSD}
\end{figure}

To measure the full prototype time of flight resolution, a collimated $^{60}$Co source was used. Figure \ref{fig:CollimatedCoToF} shows the time of flight distribution for the entire prototype. From a gaussian fit to the distribution, the time of flight resolution is $\Delta$t=547.6~ps.

\subsubsection{neutron-gamma discrimination}
The PSPMT response is different then that of the fast timing PMTs used to initially test EJ-276. This response affects the overall pulse shape, potentially affecting the pulse shape discrimination capabilities. The dynode signals contain the pulse shape discrimination information. The four position signals lose neutron-gamma information after passing through the resistive network. Figure \ref{fig:PSPMTPSD} shows the neutron-gamma discrimination using the CCM. Using the same energy cuts from the wrapping tests, the FOM is 1.070$\pm$0.016. The NEXT protype does not show any noticeable affect on neutron-gamma discrimination due to segmentation or multi-anode readout.

%\section{Conclusions}
%After extensive development guided by simulations and single segment tests, a NEXT prototype has been built with 4x8 segmentation. The SensL\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} J-Series SiPMs successfully measured neutron time of flight with less than 600 ps timing resolution, validating SiPMs as potential detectors for future development.
