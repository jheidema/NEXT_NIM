\section{Introduction}
Future rare isotope beam facilities, like FRIB, will make it possible to access the very neutron rich
side of the nuclear landscape, approaching, and even reaching the neutron drip-line in certain
cases. Far from stability, neutron separation energies become lower and accessible via beta decay \cite{FRIB}.
Therefore, beta delayed neutron spectroscopy will be an essential method of obtain information
about the nuclear structure for very neutron-rich nuclei.

\section{ Detector Design}

When the neutron kinetic  energies are measured via time-of-flight, the energy resolution is given by the following expression \cite{KORNILOV2009226}:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta E}{E}=\sqrt{\left(\frac{2\Delta t}{t}\right )^2+\left(\frac{2\Delta L}{L}\right )^2},
\label{eq:resolution}
\end{equation}

in which $t$  is the actual time-of-flight of the particle and $L$ is the corresponding flight path-length. Therefore, the energy resolution is directly related with the time resolution of the detection system, and the precision in the measurement of the path-length. This latter is mainly due the the uncertainty in the determination of the interaction point within the detector. One of the factors which limits this precision is the thickness facing the trajectory, because the interaction can occur anywhere within the detector.  Thickness is also directly related to the intrinsic efficiency: the detector has to be thick to improve the efficiency, but at the expense of a good position resolution. Typical thicknesses for plastic-scintillator-based neutron detectors are about 3~cm, which is a good trade-off between position resolution and efficiency \cite{PETERS2016122,BUTA2000412}.

\subsubsection{Detector Requirements}
The NEXT detector has to be able to measure the neutron energies in the range between 100~keV to 10~MeV. This is the region of interest for beta-delayed neutron emission and single nucleon transfer reactions, in which the neutrons emitted at forward angles have low energies\cite{}.  

Figure \label{fig:resolution} shows how the energy resolution is  affected by the thickness of the detector and the time resolution for a 1~m flight distance using Eq. \eqref{eq:resolution}. We observe that the 3~cm uncertainty in the distance of the existing VANDLE \cite{PETERS2016122} array is the main limitation in the energy resolution of this detector, especially at neutron energies above 2~MeV. Lower detector thicknesses, (3-6~mm) will have lower uncertainty in the determination of the position and  the contribution due to the time resolution becomes more important.

\caption{Conceptual design  drawings of the two possible geometries of a NEXT module detector. Each  module consists of 8 6-mm thick layers of plastic scintillator, 25~cm long}
\label{fig:NEXT_modules}
\end{figure}


The NEXT concept is based on modules of 8 multi-layered plastic scintillator detectors. Each  module consists of 8 6-mm-thick layers of plastic scintillator, therefore the total effective thickness is 4~cm. Both ends of the detector are coupled to position sensitive photosensors for reading out the light produced. These photon sensors considered  are either an array of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) or flat panel multi anode photomultiplier tubes (MAPMTs). Position sensitivity together with multiple thin layers will makes it possible to determine  accurately the interaction point of the neutrons inside the detector, reducing the uncertainty in the determination of the flight path-length, which together with the sub-nanosecond timing resolution of SiPMs and MAPMTs will improve the energy resolution significantly.

\input{Simulations}

\section{Detector tests with radioactive sources}
To  investigate the timing capabilities of thin scintillator bars, we have measured the coincidence time distribution between two photosensors attached to both ends of plastic scintillators. The output signals produced by light pulses arriving to the SiPMs were amplified using an ORTEC\textsuperscript{\textregistered}  535 fast amplifier module an then sent to the digital Data Acquisition system (DAQ). The DAQ is based on Pixie-16 digitizing modules developed by XIA LLC \cite{XIA} and it digitize the signals by means of 16-bit ADCs at 250 MS/s sampling rate.
We tested  three types of scintillator materials: regular plastic scintillator EJ-200, pulse-shape-discriminating plastic EJ-276, both manufactured by Eljen Technology \cite{eljen}, and para-terphenyl crystals produced by Proteus \cite{proteus}.

Bottom panels: Projection on the time axis of the  distributions of top panels. The red line corresponds to the gaussian fit used to determine the time resolution.}
\label{fig:SiPMtiming}
\end{figure}

In order to determine the position resolution along the detector and timing capabilities, we measured the time difference between two detectors attached to both ends of plastic scintillators. A  common $^{90}$Sr($^{90}$Y) beta source was employed. The time of each digitized pulse was determined by means of a Polynomial Constant Fraction Discrimination  algorithm (PolyCFD) \cite{PhDCory}. The algorithm fits the maximum of the pulse and it calculates from a linear interpolation the point in the leading edge in which the signal reaches a certain percentage of the maximum after baseline subtraction. The optimum values were obtained for a factor range  between $F=40-45\%$.

\subsubsection{Timing with SiPMs}
Two different electronic circuits were used during these measurements, one with on-board  filtering and amplification and another one without them. The first one consisted of a simple low-pass active filter based on the Texas Instruments\textsuperscript{\textregistered}   OPA656 operational amplifier recommended by the SiPM manufacturer. The feedback resistor value was $25\Omega$. This low resistance makes it possible to maintain the fast rise-time of the SiPM signal, while filtering high-frequency noise. However, further amplification was needed due to the low gain.  The second circuit employed does not have any on-board amplification. The signals produced by the $\beta$-particles impinging onto the scintillator plastic.


Figure \ref{fig:SiPMtiming}, shows the results of the timing measurements using a  teflon-wrapped $100\times6\times6$~mm$^3$ piece of EJ-200 plastic scintillator with the two circuits above mentioned. Left panels correspond to the circuit with active amplification and right ones the the circuit with no amplification. The top panels represent  2D-histograms of the left-right time difference  and the deposited energy in the plastic scintillator for a $^{90}$Sr($^{90}$Y) source with on-board amplification (left) and without amplification (right). We observe that the maximum of the energy distribution in the case of the SiPM circuit with amplification is lower than the one without it. This is due to the fact that signals with amplitudes larger than the 1~V-range of the ADCs which will produce and overflow were not included in the histogram. The gain of the amplifier included in the SiPM circuit boards produces the saturation at lower values of deposited energy. It is also worth to mention that the the distribution corresponding to the non amplified circuit shows a significant walk effect compared to the other one.

Lower panels of Fig. \ref{fig:SiPMtiming}, show projections on the time axis of the histograms shown in the upper panel. The time resolution is obtained from  gaussian fits of the time distributions. The resolutions obtained for the non-amplified circuit and the amplified one are $\Delta t=469$~ps (FWHM) , and   $\Delta t=548$~ps (FWHM) respectively.


 
\subsubsection{Timing with PMTs}


\subsection{Time of flight measurements}

As a proof of principle, we measured the time of flight for neutrons produced by a $^{252}$Cf neutron source using a small scale set up. It consists of a $50\times6\times6$~mm$^3$  piece of EJ200 plastic scintillator attached to $6\times6$~mm$2$ SiPMs used as START detector and a  $100\times6\times6$~mm$^3$ scintillator bar attached to another pair of SensL\textsuperscript{\textregistered}  SiPMs used as STOP. Both detectors were placed 30~cm apart. Again, due to the limited gain of the preamplifier circuit, further amplification was added with the ORTEC\textsuperscript{\textregistered}  535 amplifier. 
\subsubsection{SiPMs}
The SiPMs used are the  6-mm J-series from SensL\textsuperscript{\textregistered}
